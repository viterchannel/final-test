-- Create admin_audit_log table.
--
-- The schema for this table has lived in lib/db/src/schema/admin_sessions.ts
-- since Task #0, and the runtime helper logAdminAudit() inserts into it from
-- many places (admin login, password reset, force-change, super-admin reset
-- link, and now the seeded-admin bootstrap). However, no SQL migration was
-- ever shipped to actually create the relation, so every insert was failing
-- silently because logAdminAudit() catches its own errors.
--
-- This migration creates the table idempotently so audit entries actually
-- persist, including the first one written when the default super-admin is
-- seeded on a fresh deployment.
